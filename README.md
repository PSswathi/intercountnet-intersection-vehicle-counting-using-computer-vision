## **Business Problem:**
Picture this: You're organizing a company retreat, a school assembly, or perhaps a community gathering. As the organizer, you're keen to ensure everyone is engaged and enjoying themselves. But how can you gauge the collective mood of the group? That's where this project comes in. The aim is to develop a system capable of analyzing group images to identify the emotions of the individuals within them. By employing deep learning models and algorithms, we aim to identify whether the group is demonstrating happiness, enthusiasm, apprehension, or any other emotional state.

Such a system holds immense potential for various applications. For businesses, it could provide valuable insights into employee satisfaction during team-building events or meetings. In educational settings, it could help educators assess student engagement during lectures or group activities. Even event organizers could leverage this tool to ensure attendees are having a positive experience. Ultimately, by decoding group emotions through visual data, we strive to enhance social dynamics and foster environments favorable to collective well-being and productivity.
